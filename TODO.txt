Use Sphinx for documentation:
    http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/

See suggestions here for structuring the project repo:
    https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/

Follow numpy and use pytest for unit testing.

Classes to implement:
    Particle [DONE]
    Simulation
    ExternalForce (base)
        FreeParticle (inherits)
        OpticalForce (inherits)



I think something needs to be done to allow random number generator to be seeded for code reproducibility.
