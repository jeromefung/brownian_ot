Brownian Dynamics in Optical Tweezers
=====================================

brownian_ot is a Python and Matlab-based package for performing Brownian dynamics simulations on particles with arbitrary diffusion tensors acted on by external forces. 

In particular, it can simulate the Brownian dynamics of particles in optical tweezers by using `ott <https://github.com/ilent2/ott>`_ (by Timo Nieminen, Isaac Lenton, and co-workers) to calculate optical forces on particles.

This package also extends the capabilities of ott by using Daniel Mackowski's `mstm <http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~dmckwski/scatcodes/>`_ to calculate T-matrices for sphere clusters, enabling the computation of optical forces on sphere clusters.
